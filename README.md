# AI-Imagemaker

AI-Imagemaker is an app that uses OpenAI's DALL-E to generate high-quality images from textual descriptions. With AI-Imagemaker, you can create and share your own images with the community, as well as explore what others have created.

## Motivation

The motivation behind AI-Imagemaker was to provide a fun and creative way to explore the capabilities of OpenAI's DALL-E. I wanted to see how well the model could generate images based on textual descriptions, and provide a platform for others to experiment with it as well.

## Deployment

AI-Imagemaker is currently deployed at https://ai-imagemaker.onrender.com/.
